## Problem Statement
Civic Voice aims to solve the problem of lack of transparency and accountability in government by providing a platform for the public to track the activities and progress of elected officials. It aims to address the issue of citizens not having access to information about what their elected representatives are doing, how they are fulfilling their campaign promises and how they are representing their constituents. By providing this information, Civic Voice empowers citizens to hold their officials accountable, and also helps citizens to be informed and engage in the political process. Additionally, Civic Voice can also help to improve trust in government and strengthen the democratic process.

## Solution
Civic Voice addresses the problem of lack of transparency and accountability in government by providing a platform for the public to access information about the activities and progress of elected officials. This is done in the following ways:
1.	Tracking elected officials’ activities: The platform allows users to see what their elected officials are doing, including information on their voting records, public statements, and other actions.
2.	Fulfillment of manifesto: It allows citizens to track the progress of elected officials in fulfilling their campaign promises or manifesto, and compare it with the official’s actions and performance.
3.	Engagement: It provides an avenue for citizens to engage with their elected officials, by providing a platform for citizens to provide feedback on their performance in office, and also ask questions.
4.	Transparency: By providing easy access to information, Civic Voice also helps to increase transparency in government and allows citizens to better understand the workings of government.
5.	Informing citizens: It also helps to inform citizens and improve their understanding of the political process, by providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about who to vote for and how to engage with their elected representatives.
Overall, Civic Voice aims to empower citizens to hold their elected officials accountable, and to improve transparency and trust in government.

## Why Blockchain
Implementing Civic Voice on blockchain technology addresses the problem of threats and intimidation that those who have previously attempted similar projects in Kenya have faced. Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that can store and record information in a secure and tamper-proof way.
By using blockchain, the records of elected officials’ activities and progress can be permanently stored and cannot be altered or deleted. This would ensure that the information is always available for public scrutiny, even if the organization or individuals behind the platform face threats or intimidation.
Evidence of threats the previous team that worked on a similar idea received.
